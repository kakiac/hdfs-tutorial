Distributed and Cloud Computing - tutorial for distributed Storage using HDFS on Github Codespaces


### Notes
 - check out how to add and create your own devcontainer.json specification also see https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#creating-a-custom-dev-container-configuration
 - you need to make sure that you have installed Java, before you install Hadoop
 - 

 - Open the project in a codespace: Sign in to GitHub.com and go to your repository. Click “Use this template”, then click “Open in a codespace”. By default, the container for your codespace has many languages and runtimes, including Java1.

Add a dev container configuration: Access the Visual Studio Code Command Palette (Shift + Command + P / Ctrl + Shift + P), then start typing “add dev”. Type “java” and click the Java option. 

Then Do the same for Hadoop

Other options are available if your project uses particular tools. For example, Java & PostgreSQL1.

Choose the version of Java: Choose the version of Java you want to use for your project. In this case, select the version marked "default"1.
